I joined Radley college after winning the HMC scholarship at the age of 16 to do my A-levels. College is located near Radley, Oxfordshire, and was founded in 1847. I did 4 A-levels: Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Additional Further Mathematics and Physics and 1 AS level: Economics at Radley and was named as the best student in the Sixth Form.
